# Personal Portfolio

ðŸš§ **Under Construction**  
This repository is currently being updated with my recent projects, especially the ones I've worked on during my internship.  
Some of these projects are undergoing a design refactor to avoid conflicts with proprietary UI/UX provided by the company.  
Cleaned-up versions will be published gradually, with improved structure, code, and visuals.

## What to Expect

Here you'll soon find:

- ðŸ§  Frontend projects built with React, TypeScript, and modern UI libraries
- ðŸ’¼ Internship tasks showcasing real-world product features
- ðŸŽ¨ Refactored versions of earlier university and personal projects

Each project will include:

- A separate folder
- Clear README with technologies used, features, screenshots, and setup instructions

## Stay tuned!  

In the meantime, feel free to check out my other public repositories or contact me for more details.
